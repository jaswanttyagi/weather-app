🌦️ Weather App

The Weather App is a simple and responsive web application that provides real-time weather information for any city across the globe. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with data fetched from the OpenWeatherMap API. The app features a minimal and user-friendly interface that allows users to quickly check temperature, weather conditions, humidity, and wind speed.

🚀 Features

🌍 Search for weather information of any city worldwide.

📍 Use your current location through the Geolocation API.

🌡️ View temperature, condition, humidity, and wind speed clearly.

⚠️ Handles errors such as invalid city names or denied location access.

💻 Fully responsive design, adaptable for both desktop and mobile screens.

🧠 What I Learned

Creating this project helped me strengthen several key front-end development skills:

Using the Fetch API to connect and retrieve data from external APIs.

Managing asynchronous operations and handling API responses efficiently.

Implementing DOM manipulation to update content dynamically based on user input.

Using Geolocation API for fetching weather data of the user’s current position.

Structuring a small-scale project cleanly with separation of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML5 – for the structure and layout.

CSS3 – for styling, colors, and responsiveness.

JavaScript (ES6) – for dynamic behavior and logic.

OpenWeatherMap API – to fetch real-time weather data.

✅ Outcome

The final result is a lightweight, fast, and functional weather application that combines elegant UI with practical real-world functionality. This project enhanced my understanding of API integration, asynchronous programming, and front-end web design — key skills for building interactive web applications.
